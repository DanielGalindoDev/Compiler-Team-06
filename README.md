# Introduction

For this project, we will develop the compiler in a way that allows us to implement and understand each of its phases, gaining insight into how high-level code is transformed into machine-readable code. Throughout the process, we will explore how Python, along with its libraries, can be utilized for the construction of the compiler. Additionally, we will delve into its internal architecture and examine the functionality of each phase in detail.

The compiler is a fundamental tool that reveals the internal processes linking programming languages to hardware. This includes lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and final code generation. The project aims to tackle the challenges of implementing each phase while addressing any issues that arise during the process, with the goal of understanding their importance and functionality.

Furthermore, it highlights the essential role compilers play in modern software development and language engineering, enabling the efficient execution of programs and making programming more accessible through high-level languages. By combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementation, this project not only emphasizes the complexities of building a compiler but also underscores its relevance, as it serves as a bridge between human-readable code and hardware execution.

## 1.1 Motivation

After studying each phase of the compiler and completing the Lexical, Syntax, and Semantic Analysis stages, our challenge is to continue with the remaining phases to complete the compiler development process. This goal not only represents a challenge but also an opportunity to reinforce the knowledge we have been studying throughout the course or acquiring through programming languages. It provides an opportunity to not just create programs but also to understand how they work internally, how the source code we write is processed by the computer to be executed, and how it connects to the computerâ€™s hardware.

We will gain a practical understanding of the fundamental concepts of the remaining phases, such as intermediate code generation, code optimization, and target code generation. This project will also allow us to test our abilities to analyze and resolve difficulties that arise during the compiler development process, collaborate as a team, and ultimately achieve the goal of creating a functional compiler.

## 1.2 Goals

1. **Understanding Compiler Phases**: Explore and implement the different phases of a compiler.
2. **Leverage Python and its Libraries**: Use Python and its libraries to build the compiler, and in doing so, understand how it works and its relationship within the project.
